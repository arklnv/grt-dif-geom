# grt-dif-geom
A small calculator for various geometrical objects in General Relativity, done in Wolfram Mathematica. Given metric tensor as an input (not necessary explicitly known metrics, it can be an ansatz) it calculates the connection coefficients, the Riemann, Ricci and Einstein tensors and checks the Bianchi identities.
